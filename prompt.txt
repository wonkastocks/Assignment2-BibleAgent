   Response Format:
   "The concept of love in 1 Corinthians 13 represents more than mere emotion. As Carson (2023) explains in his comprehensive analysis [hyperlink to specific chapter], 'Love in this passage demonstrates active commitment rather than passive feeling' (p. 127). This interpretation aligns with MacArthur's (2022) exposition [hyperlink to commentary] of the Greek term ἀγάπη (agapē) as 'sacrificial action' (p. 89).
